# Escape The Arena

Escape The Arena is a very simple horror game where you must find a weapon and defeat the enemy in a colosseum before he can find you, chase you down and hit you. Being hit by the enemy causes you to lose and the game will automatically restart by spawning you and the enemy at the starting locations.

In order to defeat the enemy, you must find the weapon on the ground and interact with it to pick it up. Once you have a weapon, you can attack the enemy to defeat him and win the game. You can also interact with closets scattered around the map to hide from the enemy and evade him chasing you.

This particular game was made entirely with blueprints in Unreal Engine 5.

The controls for the game are the following:
 
* W - Move Forward
* A - Move Left
* S - Move Backwards
* D - Move Right
* F - Turn on Flashlight
* E - Interact (To hide in a closet or pick up a weapon)
* Left Mouse Button - Attack (Must be yielding weapon in order to attack)
